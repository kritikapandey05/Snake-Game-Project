# 🐍 Snake Game in Python (Tkinter)

This is a simple **Snake Game** built using **Python and Tkinter**. The game follows the classic snake mechanics:

- The snake moves in a **grid-based** environment.
- The player controls the snake using **arrow keys** (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`).
- The goal is to **eat the food** and grow the snake without hitting the walls or itself.
- If the snake **collides** with the walls or its own body, the game ends.
- Press **Spacebar** after game over to restart.
